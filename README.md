# ng-webaudio-synthesizer

This is a simple web audio synthesizer with an integrated sample player and drum machine.

This is very early, and doesn't yet have documentation. Look for blog posts and updates to the project soon.

To use:

1. Install the dependency with `npm install --save ng-webaudio-synthesizer`
2. Copy the MIDI assets from the assets directory to your Angular assets directory
2. Configure your midi mapping if using WebMidi

This will only work on Chrome, as it uses WebMidi and WebAudio...
